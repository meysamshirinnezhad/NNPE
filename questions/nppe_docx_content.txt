Physical contact of a sexual nature without consent is defined as sexual assault, which is a criminal offense and distinct from harassment.

In some provinces/territories; for professionals in private practice. B. In all provinces/territories; for professionals in private practice. C.

Project revenue generated on the land is taxed at a higher rate. C. Mortgages cannot be registered against the property. D.
