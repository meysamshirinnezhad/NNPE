**A professional has duties to their employer, clients, the profession, and the public. They also have a "duty to themselves." Which of the following actions falls outside the acceptable scope of this "duty to themselves"?**

- [ ] Insisting on all rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
- [ ] Insisting on a satisfactory work environment.
- [x] Insisting that their own best interest is a priority.
- [ ] Insisting on adequate payment from a client or employer.

**Explanation:** A professional's paramount duty is to the public welfare. While professionals have a duty to themselves (e.g., ensuring a safe workplace, fair compensation, and basic rights), this duty does not override their duties to the public, employer, or client. Insisting that their own best interest is the top priority would violate this established hierarchy of duties.

**A professional engineer relies on commercial software for a project design. The design fails after implementation, causing injury. In a subsequent lawsuit, what question is a defence lawyer most likely to ask the engineer?**

- [x] What tests were performed to verify the software was operating correctly?
- [ ] Was this the best software available for the application?
- [ ] Did you read the software's operating manual?
- [ ] Did the software company provide adequate training?

**Explanation:** Professionals are ultimately responsible for their work, including results generated by software. In a lawsuit, demonstrating due diligence is key. A lawyer will focus on whether the engineer took reasonable steps to test and verify the software's output, rather than just accepting it, to ensure it was correct and appropriate for the application.

**In which jurisdictions is liability insurance (also known as "errors and omissions" insurance) mandatory, and for which group of professionals is it most essential?**

- [x] In some provinces/territories; for professionals in private practice.
- [ ] In all provinces/territories; for professionals in private practice.
- [ ] In some provinces/territories; for professionals employed by large corporations.
- [ ] In all provinces/territories; for professionals employed by large corporations.

**Explanation:** Liability insurance requirements are not uniform across Canada; it is mandatory only in some jurisdictions. This type of insurance is most critical for professionals in private practice (e.g., consultants) because they bear direct liability and have a higher risk of being sued compared to employees of large firms, who are often covered by their employer's insurance.

**A homeowner posts untrue statements about another person on an online forum, causing injury to that person's reputation and leading to financial loss. What are the legal implications of this action?**

- [x] It can result in an actionable tort claim for defamation.
- [ ] It cannot lead to any legal liability because it was online.
- [ ] It is more legally enforceable than defamation in other mediums.
- [ ] It is less legally enforceable than defamation in other mediums.

**In the context of standards and codes of practice, what do the terms "finality" and "interpretation" refer to?**

- [ ] Finality is the time taken to review drawings; interpretation allows compliance when needed.
- [x] Finality is the state a document reaches after evaluation; interpretation is the process of applying codes to achieve that state.
- [ ] Finality is the act of sealing a document; interpretation dictates how others will use the drawings.
- [ ] Finality is taking responsibility for work; interpretation allows a contractor to choose the construction method.

**Explanation:** "Interpretation" refers to the professional's process of reviewing, understanding, and applying relevant codes and standards to their work. "Finality" is the state that work reaches once this process is complete, signifying that the document is reliable and can be used by others for its intended purpose.

**What is a key legal consideration when undertaking projects on Indigenous reserve property in Canada?**

- [ ] Corporations are required to form a joint venture with an Indigenous contractor.
- [ ] Project revenue generated on the land is taxed at a higher rate.
- [x] Mortgages cannot be registered against the property.
- [ ] Consultation is required with all Indigenous peoples within a 25 km radius.

**Explanation:** In Canada, copyright protection for an original literary, artistic, dramatic, or musical work arises automatically as soon as the work is created in a fixed form (e.g., written down, recorded). While registration provides additional benefits and proof of ownership, it is not required for the copyright to exist.
