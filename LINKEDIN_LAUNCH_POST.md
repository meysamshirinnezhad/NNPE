NPPE Pro solves this:
→ Unlimited practice exams (500+ questions)
→ Instant feedback on which topics to review

**Title**: "I built a platform to help engineers pass the NPPE exam (Canadian P.Eng licensure)"

**Body**:

Hey engineers,

After struggling to prepare for my NPPE exam (the Canadian professional practice exam for P.Eng designation), I built a platform to solve the problem I had: **not knowing if I was ready.**

**What it does**:
- 500+ practice questions covering all exam topics
- Full-length mock exams with realistic timing
- Instant breakdown showing your weak areas

## 🎁 LAUNCH OFFER STRATEGY

### Option 1: Limited Time Discount (Recommended)
```
"First 100 users: 50% off forever"
Monthly: $14.99 (normally $29.99)
Annual: $149.99 (normally $299.99)
```

**Why**: Creates urgency, rewards early adopters, recurring revenue

### Option 2: Lifetime Deal
```
"Founding members: $99 lifetime access"
(Normally $29.99/month = $360/year)
```

**Why**: Immediate cash, super attractive offer

### Option 3: Extended Trial
```
"First 50 users: 30-day free trial"
(Normally 7 days)
```

**Why**: More time to prove value, less immediate revenue

**My Recommendation**: Option 1 (50% off forever) - Best balance of urgency + recurring revenue.

If you see these, pivot quickly:

1. **<1% signup rate**: Landing page message unclear
